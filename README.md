SpechtCMDLauncher
=================

Due to multiple installs of windows and remaking batch files to launch applications.
I am making this in hopes of making that easier for myself, and others that dislike doing such a thing.

Once this is in a working state, you should be able to add teh location of this to your windows %path.
Then run the program by typing 'launch'

When making your config.cfg file make sure you don't have any uneeded spaces.
If the path you enter has spaces in it please be sure to add "quotes" around it because that is the standard way to
  use quotes in a path in windows commandline. Also please sure its the full path to the executable file you want. 
  not just the parent directory of it.
